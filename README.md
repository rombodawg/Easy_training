A single runnable file for LLM training. Everything you need can be executed from the 1 file. Pick your method of training from the file name. Fill in all the places in the file with what you need to train, and run "Python *File_Name.py*" from a command prompt open in the same directory as the file.

As long as you have some sort of graphics card and train a model that fits in your VRAM, the training should work well.

It's as simple as that.
